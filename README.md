# Description
```
Our application will allow users to search for podcasts by keyword, genre, network, or host and will return a list of podcasts fitting those results. On the results page the user can view information about the podcast, including a summary of the podcast, genre info, host info and network info. The user can then choose to add a podcast from that list to a library (“stash”)  and have the option to like or dislike. When the user views their “stash” they see the list of podcasts that they have saved with a link to listen to the podcast. Users will also be able to upload podcasts to the database, after submitting a form.
