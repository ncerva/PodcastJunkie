# PodcastJunkie

## Description
Our application will allow users to search for podcasts by keyword and genre and will return a list of podcasts fitting those results. On the results page the user can view information about the podcast, including a summary of the podcast, genre info, host info and network info. The user can then choose to add a podcast from that list to a library **(“My Stash”)** and have the option to like or dislike the podcast as a form of rating. When the user views their **Stash** they see the list of podcasts that they have saved with a link to listen to the podcast.

## User Story
```
As an employee who commutes to work for about an hour everyday, 
I want to be able to search and discover new podcasts by keyword and genre. 

When I search for podcasts, I am given a list of results matching my query.

When I click on a search result, I can view information about the podcast, including a link to listen to the podcast, title, a summary of the podcast, and genre.

When I click on a search result I can choose to add the podcast to My Stash.

When I click on a search result I can like or dislike a podcast and its current score is saved in the database. 

When I view my stash I can see a list of podcasts I have saved to listen to.
